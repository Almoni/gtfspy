``gtfspy`` is a Python package for working with public transport timetable data provided in the [General Transit Feeds Specification](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/) (GTFS) format.

## Core features:
* Import one or multiple GTFS feeds into a [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) database.
* Update this sqlite database using Open Street Map (OSM) data.
* Compute summary statistics
* Filter databases spatially and temporally
* Perform accessibility analyses using a routing/profiling engine
    - Routing implementation [Connection Scan Algorithm](http://i11www.iti.uni-karlsruhe.de/extra/publications/dpsw-isftr-13.pdf) (CSA).
    - Used for computing travel times and transfers between origin-destination pairs

## Prerequisites
* [Python 3.5 (or above)](https://www.python.org/)
* Supported platforms: Linux + OSX (Windows is currently not supported, please creat an issue in Github if you would be interested in running ``gtfspy`` on Windows)
* Optional: [git](https://git-scm.com/) is used for development.


## Install

```
pip install --process-dependency-links gtfspy
```

## Development quickstart

Only use this if you want to be able to edit ``gtfspy``'s source code.

```
git clone git@github.com:CxAalto/gtfspy.git
cd gtfspy/
pip install -r requirements.txt # install any requirements
nosetests . # run tests
```

Remember to also add the ``gtfspy`` directory to your ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable.
