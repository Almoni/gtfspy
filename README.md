# gtfspy

The gtfspy python package is used for routing, transforming, filtering and validating public transport timetable data in the General Transit Feeds Specification (GTFS) format.
For more information about the GTFS standard: https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/

Current core features:
* Transformation of one GTFS feed or merging several GTFS feeds into a sqlite database
* Importing of Open Street Map (OSM) street layer for pedestrian routing
* Routing engine using the Connection Scan Algorithm (CSA)

Support features:
* Validation of GTFS feeds
* Extraction of basic summary statics about the feed

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
* Support for Python 3.4
