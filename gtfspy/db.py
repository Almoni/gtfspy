"""Search for and open databases.

This file provides some functions for opening database files.  This is a
bit more complex than it seems, since it has to search in different
places for them, both on personal computers and BECS computers.  On BECS
computers, there are also the DBs in scratch, and the DBs in local
storage.

If you are missing databases,
  mkdir -p scratch/db/
and the copy the databases you need from BECS:
  rsync -aiP amor:/scratch/networks/rmkujala/transit/db/<NAME> scratch/db/


The following functions exist:
  connect_*
  path_*
  *_gtfs
  *_gps

The connect_* functions return an sqlite3.Connection object, and the
path_* functions return the detected database path.  The *_gtfs paths
return GTFS data, and the argument 'name' is like hsl-2015-04-24, and
*_gps returns the GPS data, and the argument is the tag, like
'2015-03-01'.

The connection functions take a `mode` argument, a lot like the `open`
function.  The point here is that if you open with the 'r' mode (the
default), it will make an error if the database doesn't exist yet.  This
is important, because otherwise sqlite will create a new, empty database
and it won't work.
